    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>My name is Alex Arrington. I was born in Portland and I am 27 almost 28 years old. This is my <strong>first time trying coding!</strong></p>
  
    <h2>Here are some of my favorite activities</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Soccer is one of my favorite sports. I played for two year in college at small dvivsion three school.

      <li>I recently traveled to Europe for the first time and spent time in London, Amsteram, Germany, Italy, Spain and France. Where I also got to see many soccer matches like this one in Paris!

    <h2>Work</h2>
    <p>I work in construction as a carpenter so coding is sort of the polar opposite for me. However I have always had a passion for video games and have recently built a computer for myself. I decided to try Epicodus because a family friend had to decided to take the full course and had recieved an internship from it. It seemed like a good opportunity to try something new and possibly make something out of it.</p>
